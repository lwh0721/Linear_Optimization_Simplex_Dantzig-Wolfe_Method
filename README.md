Linear Optimization by Matlab (2022 Fall)

Solve Farming Stochastic Programming Model Problem by using:

(1) The Simplex Method; 

(2) The Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition Method;

(3) The Linprog Method (the Matlab package).

And then also three methods are compared.

The 'coefficient_generator' code generates the coefficients for the stochastic programming farming model automatically.
